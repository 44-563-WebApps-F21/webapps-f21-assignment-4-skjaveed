             <p class="stage-direction">[Calling.]</p> Cecily, Cecily! Surely such a utilitarian occupation as the
             watering of flowers is rather Moulton’s duty than yours? Especially at
             a moment when intellectual pleasures await you. Your German grammar is
             on the table. Pray open it at page fifteen. We will repeat yesterday’s
             lesson.</p>

            <p Class="stage-direction">[Coming over very slowly.]</p> But I don’t like German. It isn’t at all a
             becoming language. I know perfectly well that I look quite plain after
             my German lesson.</p>

             <p>Child, you know how anxious your guardian is that you should improve
             yourself in every way. He laid particular stress on your German, as he
             was leaving for town yesterday. Indeed, he always lays stress on your
             German when he is leaving for town.</p>

             <p>Dear Uncle Jack is so very serious! Sometimes he is so serious that I
             think he cannot be quite well</p>

             <p class="stage-direction">[Drawing herself up.]</p> <p>Your guardian enjoys the best of health, and his
             gravity of demeanour is especially to be commended in one so
             comparatively young as he is. I know no one who has a higher sense of
             duty and responsibility.</p>
