           <p class="stage-direction">[Calling.]</p> <p>Cecily, Cecily! Surely such a utilitarian occupation as the
           watering of flowers is rather Moulton’s duty than yours? Especially at
           a moment when intellectual pleasures await you. Your German grammar is
           on the table. Pray open it at page fifteen. We will repeat yesterday’s
           lesson.</p>

           <h6 class="name CECILY">CECILY</h6>
          <p Class="stage-direction">[Coming over very slowly.]</p> <p>But I don’t like German. It isn’t at all a
           becoming language. I know perfectly well that I look quite plain after
           my German lesson.</p>

           <p>Child, you know how anxious your guardian is that you should improve
           yourself in every way. He laid particular stress on your German, as he
           was leaving for town yesterday. Indeed, he always lays stress on your
           German when he is leaving for town.</p>
 
           <p class="speech">

           <p>Dear Uncle Jack is so very serious! Sometimes he is so serious that I
           think he cannot be quite well</p>

           <p class="stage-direction">[Drawing herself up.]</p> <p>Your guardian enjoys the best of health, and his
           gravity of demeanour is especially to be commended in one so
           comparatively young as he is. I know no one who has a higher sense of
           duty and responsibility.</p>

           <p class="speech">
            <h6 class="name CECILY">CECILY</h6>
          <p>I suppose that is why he often looks a little bored when we three are
           together</p>

            <h6 class= "name MISSPRISM">MISSPRISM</h6>
           <p>Cecily! I am surprised at you. Mr. Worthing has many troubles in his
           life. Idle merriment and triviality would be out of place in his
           conversation. You must remember his constant anxiety about that
           unfortunate young man his brother.</p>
           
         <p class="speech">
            <h6 class="namen CECILY">CECILY</h6>
           <p>I wish Uncle Jack would allow that unfortunate young man, his brother,
           to come down here sometimes. We might have a good influence over him,
           Miss Prism. I am sure you certainly would. You know German, and
           geology, and things of that kind influence a man very much. <p>[Cecily
           begins to write in her diary.]</p></p>

           <p class="speech">
            <h6 class= "MISSPRISM">MISSPRISM</h6>
           <p class="stage-direction">[Shaking her head.]</p> <p>I do not think that even I could produce any effect
           on a character that according to his own brother’s admission is
           irretrievably weak and vacillating. Indeed I am not sure that I would
           desire to reclaim him. I am not in favour of this modern mania for
           turning bad people into good people at a moment’s notice. As a man sows
           so let him reap. You must put away your diary, Cecily. I really don’t
           see why you should keep a diary at all.</p>
    
           <p class="speech">
            <h6 class="CECILY">CECILY</h6>
           <p>I keep a diary in order to enter the wonderful secrets of my life. If I
           didn’t write them down, I should probably forget all about them.</p>

           <p class="speech">
            <h6 class= "MISSPRISM">MISSPRISM</h6>
           <p>Memory, my dear Cecily, is the diary that we all carry about with us.</p>

           <p class="speech">
            <h6 class="CECILY">CECILY</h6>
           <p>Yes, but it usually chronicles the things that have never happened, and
           couldn’t possibly have happened. I believe that Memory is responsible
           for nearly all the three-volume novels that Mudie sends us.</p>

           <p class="speech">
            <h6 class= "MISSPRISM">MISSPRISM</h6>
           <p>Do not speak slightingly of the three-volume novel, Cecily. I wrote one
           myself in earlier days.</p>

           <p class="speech">
            <h6 class="CECILY">CECILY</h6>
           <p>Did you really, Miss Prism? How wonderfully clever you are! I hope it
          did not end happily? I don’t like novels that end happily. They depress
          me so much.</p>

          <p class="speech">
            <h6 class= "MISSPRISM">MISSPRISM</h6>
          <p>The good ended happily, and the bad unhappily. That is what Fiction
          means.</p>

          <p class="speech">
            <h6 class="CECILY">CECILY</h6>
          <p>I suppose so. But it seems very unfair. And was your novel ever
          published?</p>
 
          <p class="speech">
            <h6 class= "MISSPRISM">MISSPRISM</h6>
         <p>Alas! no. The manuscript unfortunately was abandoned. <p>[Cecily starts.]</p>
         I use the wod in the sense of lost or mislaid. To your work, child,
         these speculations are profitless.</p>

         <p class=stage-direction[Smiling.]</p> <p> But I see dear Dr. Chasuble coming up through the garden.</p>
